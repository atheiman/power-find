# Power Find

A Chrome extension designed to be a more powerful alternative to the builtin find tool. Click the extension icon, enter a search pattern, and press enter. Optionally select regex matching (passes pattern directly to [JavaScript's `RegExp()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp)) and/or ignore-case.

Matches will be highlighted, and you can step through the matches with the up and down arrows.

Theres really not a lot to explain.
